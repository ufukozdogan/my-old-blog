# Imperfect Today

This is the Jekyll repo for my blog. It is based off of [pixyll.com](http://www.pixyll.com) by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com) and changes made by ([@emcconne](https://twitter.com/emcconne)). Thanks to you both. <3

I just made couple of changes here and there also removed some stuff that I don't think I'll be needing. Posts are solely written by me.
