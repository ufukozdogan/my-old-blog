This is an environment to simply serve me as a personal escape ground and 
as a place where I share my experiences and ideas whether it's a technological 
article or simply a game review. I'm really into programming and gaming since 
I know myself. Never been an "outside" guy, never enjoyed social activities 
as much as other people do and frankly, I truly enjoy spending time in front 
of a screen or with my most-beloveds doing something new and excites me.  

Now now, don't think less of me. Spending your time facing against glowy 
glass, does come with benefits though. I don't think I lack communication 
with people but that's not my strength either, no, definitely not. 
My true strength is Internet. Watching every viral video, listening 
music intensively, watching movies, playing video games and following 
a trend or simply stalking front-facing internet pages like Reddit 
throughtout the years furnishes you unimaginable culture bombardment 
and gives me pure joy. Hell, in some days an idea comes to my mind 
and "Hey, 'member when this happened and everybody was like this?" and 
I say to myself "Yeah.. I, uhm, don't 'member it exactly. Damn it." and 
google it like a fourty year old, trying to find what it was and get its 
details. It gets cluttery sometimes but at the same time, it's kinda nostalgic. 

So basically, this blog will be present mainly for that reason. To collect 
my opinions and experiences and be a memoir for me-self. There will still 
be articles about various stuff but time will what I'll be focusing on the most.  

Anyways, enough chit-chat. Have a good time in both worlds.
